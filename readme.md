Two things must be set they depend on weather or not you have codeigniter within your root directory please consult the beginning of these files respectively.

/applications/tools/rdip.php
/example.php

If you are using wordpress use:

<?php get_template_part('header'); ?>

rather than:

<?php get_header(); ?>

If you have any questions please file a ticket in "issues" within github.
